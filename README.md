# auto-mpg

## Introduction
This is a simple project to predict the fuel efficiency of a car using a simple linear regression model. The dataset used for this project is the Auto MPG dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains 398 instances and 9 attributes. The attributes are as follows:

1. mpg: continuous
2. cylinders: multi-valued discrete
3. displacement: continuous
4. horsepower: continuous
5. weight: continuous
6. acceleration: continuous
7. model year: multi-valued discrete
8. origin: multi-valued discrete
9. car name: string (unique for each instance)

## Data
The dataset is available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/auto+mpg).

## Methodology
The methodology used for this project is as follows:
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Model Building
4. Model Evaluation

## Conclusion
The model was able to predict the fuel efficiency of a car with an accuracy of ~90%.
